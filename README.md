# Practice-Complex-SQL-Queries
I wrote 9 SQL Queries to practice intermediate to complex SQL queries.  


Query 1: Write a SQL Query to fetch all the duplicate records in a table.
- Solution 1:
select *
from users u
where u.ctid not in (
select min(ctid) as ctid
from users
group by user_name
order by ctid);
-- Solution 2: 
select user_id, user_name, email
from (
select *,
row_number() over (partition by user_name order by user_id) as rn
from users u
order by user_id) x
where x.rn <> 1;


Query 2: Write a SQL query to fetch the second last record from employee table.
select emp_id, emp_name, dept_name, salary
from (
select *,
row_number() over (order by emp_id desc) as rn
from employee e) x
where x.rn = 2;


Query 3: Write a SQL query to display only the details of employees who either earn the highest salary or the lowest salary in each department from the employee table.
select x.*
from employee e
join (select *,
max(salary) over (partition by dept_name) as max_salary,
min(salary) over (partition by dept_name) as min_salary
from employee) x
on e.emp_id = x.emp_id
and (e.salary = x.max_salary or e.salary = x.min_salary)
order by x.dept_name, x.salary;


Query 4: From the doctors table, fetch the details of doctors who work in the same hospital but in different specialty.
select d1.name, d1.speciality,d1.hospital
from doctors d1
join doctors d2
on d1.hospital = d2.hospital
and d1.id <> d2.id;


Query 5: From the login_details table, fetch the users who logged in consecutively 3 or more times.
select distinct repeated_names
from (
select *,
case when user_name = lead(user_name) over(order by login_id)
and  user_name = lead(user_name,2) over(order by login_id)
then user_name else null end as repeated_names
from login_details) x
where x.repeated_names is not null;


Query 6: From the students table, write a SQL query to interchange the adjacent student names.
select id,student_name,
case when id%2 <> 0 then lead(student_name,1,student_name) over(order by id)
when id%2 = 0 then lag(student_name) over(order by id) end as new_student_name
from students;


Query 7: From the weather table, fetch all the records when London had extremely cold temperature for 3 consecutive days or more.
elect id, city, temperature, day
from (
    select *,
        case when temperature < 0
              and lead(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lead(temperature,2) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        when temperature < 0
              and lead(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lag(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        when temperature < 0
              and lag(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lag(temperature,2) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        end as flag
    from weather) x
where x.flag = 'Y';


Query 8: From the following 3 tables (event_category, physician_speciality, patient_treatment), write a SQL query to get the histogram of specialties of the unique physicians who have done the procedures but never did prescribe anything.
select ps.speciality, count(1) as speciality_count
from patient_treatment pt
join event_category ec on ec.event_name = pt.event_name
join physician_speciality ps on ps.physician_id = pt.physician_id
where ec.category = 'Procedure'
and pt.physician_id not in (select pt2.physician_id
							from patient_treatment pt2
							join event_category ec on ec.event_name = pt2.event_name
							where ec.category in ('Prescription'))
group by ps.speciality;


Query 9: Find the top 2 accounts with the maximum number of unique patients on a monthly basis.
select a.month, a.account_id, a.no_of_unique_patients
from (
		select x.month, x.account_id, no_of_unique_patients,
			row_number() over (partition by x.month order by x.no_of_unique_patients desc) as rn
		from (
				select pl.month, pl.account_id, count(1) as no_of_unique_patients
				from (select distinct to_char(date,'month') as month, account_id, patient_id
						from patient_logs) pl
				group by pl.month, pl.account_id) x
     ) a
where a.rn < 3;


*** THE END ***
